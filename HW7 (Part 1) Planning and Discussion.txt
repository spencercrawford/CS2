Description   : Implement a Hash Table to index and search for words in a file

Planning

Step 1)
	Process file and generate number of unique words
Step 2)
	create Node class
Step 3)
	create Hash Table Class
	Everything must be a function
	create functions for prime numbers
Step 4)
	Implement Everything in HW7 class
Step 5)
	Debug debug debug

Discussion
	So the first thing I did was create the Node class, which I named LinkedHashEntry. There were no problems there. The Second thing that I did was create the Hash Table class. I struggled at first attempting to fully grasp the concept of a Hash Table, so I watched a few YouTube videos before I really wrote out my methods on paper. Once that was done, I started working on how to choose a prime number, and select the next highest prime number based on user input. Once the Hash Table class was done, I got down to implementing it in the HW7 class. Creating the Hash Table was easy, but what I spent most of my time on, was checking for errors in user input (making sure input is an int / not a string etc.).
	Hash Tables are so cool! I really like how much it speeds up my access time to elements in the list, and am looking forward to using a hash table in my personal projects outside of school in the future!
