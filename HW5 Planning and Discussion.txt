Description : Creates a sorted list of words and the displays the number of times each word occurs.

Planning and process:

Step 1)
	Create a list of words based on the words in the source file

Step 2)
	Remove all special characters from the list

Step 3)
	Count all duplicates in the list and store them in another list

Step 4)
	Search array for duplicates and remove them. clock the wall clock and cpu times of these operations

Step 5)
	Print out the results

Discussion:
	I ran into a couple of issues while attempting to remove the special characters from the list. The method I used does not seem to support removing characters from a collection. To solve this problem, I copied the list into an array, and then removed the special characters. I then later converted the string array back into a collection.
	Next, I tried a couple of different methods to find the number of duplicates, all gave me outrageous access times. I finally discovered Collections.frequency, and was amazing at how much faster the operation was completed!
	Lastly, I spent a bit of time altering the loop I used for the removeDuplicates method, since several attempts cut out the very last index of my list. I ended up solving the issue however.
